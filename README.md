# boolean-to-stick-diagram
This project focuses on converting Boolean expressions into Stick diagrams using C++
The core functionality appears to be implemented in the file graph.cpp, which provides methods to parse and manipulate Boolean expressions, generate corresponding graphs, and create NMOS and PMOS transistor-level diagrams.
